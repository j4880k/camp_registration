			<p><b>Currently the following activity is functional:</b>

			<li>User Can Login to Account - If you are reading this page then you have signed up (created user account) and logged in.</li>
			<li>User Can Create Participants (campers) [Person] - To review your existing registrants or to create new ones please click the "View Registrants" menu item above.</li>
			<li>User Can create contacts [SimpleContact] and associated items like phones, emails and insurances - Each camper has a list of contacts associated with their record. These contacts are used by camp staff for emergency contacts and other purposes.</li>
			<li>User Can Create Reservation for an event [Person/Registration association]</li>
			<li>User Can Add Reservations to cart &amp; remove them from the cart (before proceeding to checkout)</li>
			<li>User Can Apply coupons to Invoice (checkout phase)</li>
			<li>User Can Cancel Invoices</li>
			<li>Registrant (Person) progress tracked through required fields. This allows incomplete saves but no Reservations until 100%</li>
			</ul>
			<br/> There could be a number of requests and observations about the app that should be considered. Please direct your feedback to Rich and Chris.
			<br/> Thank you for your time and help as we bring the application together. 
			<br/> As a programmer there are probably a lot of things I take for granted that you might not. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Next Steps:
				<ul>
					<li> Primary focus is getting the invoice/payment portion implemented.</li>
					<li> Continually respond to data and workflow improvements. (with your help)</li>
				</ul>
